# Step 1: Use an official Node.js image as the base image for building
FROM node:16 AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json first (for caching npm install)
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of your application files
COPY . .

# Build the React app
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the production build using Nginx or any static file server
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build folder from the build stage to Nginx's public folder
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 for HTTP traffic
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx to serve the app
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
